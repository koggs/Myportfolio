- me: About Me
  description: I am Icelandic, mother of twin girls, lives near Gothenburg, Sweden who really wanted to become a developer so I entered a bootcamp which I graduated from at the end of june 2018 as a junior fullstack web developer from Craft Academy's 12 week bootkamp.
               In this bootcamp we learned Test Driven Developement, pair programming using Git as version control and setting up and using framemwork in both Ruby and javaScript. We used Agile project management and Scrum for developing our projects.
               The projects we did during the bootcamp contain both websites and mobile applications.
