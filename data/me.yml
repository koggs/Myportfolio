- me: About Me
  description:
    I am Icelandic, mother of twin girls, located near Gothenburg, Sweden who really wanted to become a developer so I entered a bootcamp which I graduated from in 2018 as a web developer from Craft Academy's 12 week bootkamp.
    In this bootcamp we learned Test Driven Developement, pair programming using Git as version control and setting up and using framemwork in both Ruby and javaScript. We used Agile project management and Scrum for developing our projects.
    The projects we did during the bootcamp contain both websites and mobile applications.
